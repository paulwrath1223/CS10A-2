Programming Challenges using loops: run-time input/value processing – (WEEK#7)

1.	Sum of Numbers  (SAMPLE 1)

Write a program that asks the user for a positive integer value. The program should use a loop to get the sum of all the integers from 1 up to the number entered. For example, if the user enters 5, the loop will find the sum of 1,2,3,…….5.
       What type of a loop is this?
Input Validation: Do not accept a negative starting number.
															
2.	Sum of Numbers (SAMPLE 2a)

Write a program that asks the user for several integer values and ends when the user inputs a -1. The program should use a loop to sum of all the positive integers entered. For example, if the user enters 5, 3, 2, -5, 6, 8,-1 the loop will find the sum of 5, 3, 2, 6 & 8. 
What type of a loop is this?
															
3.	Sum of Numbers (SAMPLE 2b)
Write a program that asks the user for a data file with several integer values and ends when a negative value (for example -5) is found. The program should use a loop to sum of all the positive integers in the file. For example, if the file contains 5, 3, 2, -5, 6, 8,-1 the loop will find the sum of 5, 3, 2. 
What type of a loop is this?
Input Validation: Include necessary data validation routines to check for state of the file stream.
