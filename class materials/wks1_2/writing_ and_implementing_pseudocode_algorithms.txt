1.Write detailed pseudo code for a program (aee payroll2.cpp above) that calculates user’s gross pay when given inputs for hours worked and hourly pay rate. Use variables named hours, rate, and pay. 
               
Input hours           // with prompt  ... Ask the user to input the number of hours worked
Input rate            // with prompt  ... Ask the user to input the hourly pay rate
pay = hours * rate
Display pay 


2. Convert the following pseudo code to C++ code. Be sure to define the appropriate variables. 
Store 30 in the speed variable.
Store 10 in the time variable.
Multiply speed by time and store the result in the distance variable. Display the contents of the distance variable.


3. Convert the following pseudo code to C++ code. Be sure to define the appropriate variables.
Store 172.5 in the force variable. Store 27.5 in the area variable.
Divide force by area and store the result in the pressure variable. Display the contents of the pressure variable.
