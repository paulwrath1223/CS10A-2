the television and sitting down to watch it. It's a&nbsp; communicating tool we
use to enhance our lives. Computers are becoming as common as televisions,
computers are based on complex principles but are designed for easy use.</font><font size="1"></p>
<p></font><font face="verdana, arial, helvetica" size="2" color="#666666">Computers are dumb; they must
be told what to do. A true computer error is extremely rare (usually due to a
component malfunction or an electrical fault). Because we tell the computer what
to do, most errors in computer generated output are really human errors.</font><font size="1"></p>

  <li type="square"><font size="2" color="#666666" face="verdana, arial, helvetica"><b>Computer programming is the
    process of planning a sequence of steps for a computer to follow.</b>
    It involves a <b> problem-solving phase</b> and an <b> implementation phase</b>. After
    analyzing a problem, we develop and test a general solution [algorithm].
    This general solution becomes a concrete solution-our program-when we write
    it in a high-level programming language. The sequence of instructions that
    makes up our program is then compiled into machine code, the language the
    computer uses. After correcting any errors or &quot;bugs&quot; that show up
    during testing, our program is ready to use. Once we begin to use the
    program, it enters the <b>maintenance phase</b>. Maintenance involves
    correcting any errors discovered while the program is being used and
    changing the program to reflect changes in the user's requirements.<br>
    </font></li>
  <li><font size="2" color="#666666" face="verdana, arial, helvetica">Data and instructions are
    represented as <b>binary numbers</b>
    [numbers consisting of 0s and 1s] in electronic computers. The process of
    converting data and instructions into a form usable by the computer is
    called <b>coding</b>.<br>
    </font></li>
  <li><font size="2" color="#666666" face="verdana, arial, helvetica"><b>A programming language
    reflects the range of operations a computer can perform.</b>
    The basic control structures in a programming language-sequence, selection,
    loop, and subprogram-are based on these fundamental operations. Using this
    course, you learn to write programs in the high-level programming
    language called C++.<br>
    </font></li>
  <li><font size="2" color="#666666" face="verdana, arial, helvetica">Computers are composed of
    <b>six
    basic parts</b>: the memory unit, the
    arithmetic/logic unit, the control unit, input and output devices, and
    auxiliary storage devices. The arithmetic/logic unit and control unit
    together are called the central processing unit. The physical parts of the
    computer are called hardware. The programs that are executed by the computer
    are called software.<br>
    </font></li>
  <li><font size="2" color="#666666" face="verdana, arial, helvetica"><b>System software is a set of
    programs designed to simplify the user/computer interface.</b>
    It includes the compiler, the operating system, and the editor.</font> <font size="2" color="#666666" face="verdana, arial, helvetica">Computing
    professionals are guided by a set of ethics, as are members of other
    professions. Among the responsibilities that we have are copying software
    only with permission and including attribution to other programmers when we
    make use of their code, guarding the privacy of confidential data, using
    computer resources only with permission, and carefully engineering our
    programs so that they work correctly.<br>
    </font></li>
  <li><font face="verdana, arial, helvetica" size="2" color="#666666"><b>Problem solving is an
    integral part of the programming process.</b>
    Although you may have little experience programming computers, you have a
    lot of experience solving problems. The key is to stop and think about the
    strategies we use to solve problems, and then use those strategies to devise
    workable algorithms. Among those strategies are asking questions, looking
    for things that are familiar, solving by analogy, apply mean-ends analysis,
    dividing the problem into subproblems, using existing solutions to small
    problems to solve larger problems, merging solutions, and paraphrasing the
    problem in order to overcome a mental block. <!--webbot
