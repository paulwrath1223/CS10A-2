// This program will write the name, address and telephone number of the programmer.

// PLACE YOUR NAME HERE

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main()
{
	// Fill in this space to write your first and last name
	// Fill in this space to write your address (on new line)
	// Fill in this space to write you city, state and zip (on new line)
	// Fill in this space to write your telephone number (on new line)

	return 0;
}


/* Program updates: 

Open the file name.cpp from the demo_ch2 folder
Fill in the code so that the program will do the following:
Write your first and last name on one line.
Write your address on the next line (recall the function of the endl statement). 
Write your city, state and zip on the next line.
Write your telephone number on the next line.
Remember that to output a literal, such as “Hello”, you must use quotes. 
Compile and run the program.

Here is a sample program output

Deano Beano
123 Markadella Lane
Fruitland, Md. 55503
489-555-5555 

Now update the program so that three blank lines separate the telephone number from the address. 
Compile and run the program. 


Update the program one more time so that the following (but with your name and address) is printed. 
Try to get the spacing just like the example. 
Compile and run the program.
