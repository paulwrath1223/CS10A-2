// This program will output the circumference and area
// of the circle with a given radius.

// PLACE YOUR NAME HERE

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

const double PI = 3.14;
const double RADIUS = 5.4;

int main()
{
	area					// definition of area of circle 
	float circumference;			// definition of circumference 
	circumference = 2 * PI * RADIUS;	// computes circumference
	area = ;				// computes area

	// Fill in the code for the cout statement that will output (with description)
	// the circumference

	// Fill in the code for the cout statement that will output (with description)
	// the area of the circle

	return 0;
}

/* program updates

Open the file circlearea.cpp from the demo_ch2 folder into your C++ compiler

Fill in the blanks and the cout statements so that the output will produce the following:

The circumference of the circle is 33.912
The area of the circle is 91.5624 */


Now change the data type of circumference from float to int. Run the program and record the results.

The circumference of the circle is: 

The area of the circle is: 

Explain what happened to get the above results.


/* Write a new program 

Using the prior example, develop a program that will determine the area and perimeter of a rectangle. 
The length and width can be given as constants. (LENGTH=8 WIDTH=3)

Compile and run your program. Continue to work on it until you get the following output.

The area of the rectangle is 24
The perimeter of the rectangle is 22
