State of an IO Stream
In Chapter 4, we said that all references to an input or output stream are ignored if the stream is in the fail state. The fail state is entered if the file that is the parameter to the open operation isn’t found, if you try to input from a stream after all the values have been read, or if invalid data is encountered in the input stream. C++ provides a way to test the state of a stream: The stream name used in an expression returns true if the state is okay and false if the stream is in the fail state. Look at the following example.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

// Program Area demonstrates stream testing
#include <iostream>
#include <fstream>
using namespace std;

int main()
{
    int side1;		// one side of a rectangle
    int side2;		// the other side of a rectangle
    ifstream inData;	// file stream
    int area;		// area of rectangle

    inData.open("myData.dat");
    if (!inData)
    {
        cout  << "Input file not found."  << endl;
        return 1;
    }
    inData >> side1 >> side2;
    if (!inData)
    {
        cout  << "Data format incorrect.";
        return 2;
    }
    area = side1 * side2;
    cout  << "Area is "  << area  << endl;
    return 0;
} 

CONTENTS OF DATA FILE myData.dat 
5 5
______________________________________________________

If the input file myData.dat cannot be found, 1 is returned to the operating system. If the data format on file inData is incorrect, 2 is returned to the operating system. If there are no input errors, 0 is returned to the operating system. Notice that the function main is exited as soon as a value is returned. Therefore, there are three ways that this function can be completed: two with an error (return 1 or 2) and one with no error (return 0). Returning 0 means normal completion of a program; returning any other value signals an error. When you are writing your program, you may choose the values to return to indicate different error conditions.
